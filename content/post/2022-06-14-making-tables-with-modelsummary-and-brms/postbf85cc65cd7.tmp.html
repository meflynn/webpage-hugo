<p><strong>tl;dr: Learn how to make some cool, customizable, tables for multinomial logit models using {brms} and {modelsummary}.</strong></p>
<p>The title is a little too general—this is really a post about making some nice, publication-quality tables specifically for multinomial models using {brms} and {modelsummary}. I’m coming off a couple of long projects where we were running a lot of these. Actually, started using {brms} several years ago partly because I had data where we had 1) lots of individuals making choices, 2) those individuals were all grouped in some pretty clear ways, and 3) we were also interested in modeling group-level characteristics that might relate to individuals’ choices. This more or less marked my full transition from Stata to R and from frequentist stats to Bayesian stats.</p>
<p>First, for those who aren’t familiar {brms} is an amazing package created by <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/">Paul B\’’{u}erkner</a>.</p>
