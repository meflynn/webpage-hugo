<p><strong>tl;dr: Learn how to make some cool, customizable, tables for multinomial logit models using {brms} and {modelsummary}.</strong></p>
<p>The title is a little too general—this is really a post about making some nice, publication-quality tables specifically for multinomial models using {brms} and {modelsummary}. I’m coming off a couple of long projects where we were running a lot of these. I actually started using {brms} partly because I had data where we had 1) lots of individuals making choices, and 2) those individuals were all grouped in some pretty clear ways.</p>
