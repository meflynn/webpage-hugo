<p>The title is a little too general—this is really a post about making some nice, publication-quality tables specifically for multinomial models using {brms} and {modelsummary}. I’m coming off a couple of long projects where we were running a lot of these. Actually, started using {brms} several years ago partly because I had data where we had 1) lots of individuals making choices, 2) those individuals were all grouped in some pretty clear ways, and 3) we were also interested in modeling group-level characteristics that might relate to individuals’ choices. This more or less marked my full transition from Stata to R and from frequentist stats to Bayesian stats.</p>
<p>First, for those who aren’t familiar {brms} is an amazing package created by <a href="https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/">Paul Bürkner</a>. It stands for Bayesian Regression Modeling using Stan, and, as the name suggests, provides users with a convenient front-end for building regression models using Stan as a back end. This is particularly useful for building multilevel models, but also lots of other stuff.</p>
<p>Second, {modelsummary} is another amazing and ever-expanding package created by <a href="https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/">Vincent Arel-Bundock</a>. This packages does a few different things, but most importantly and prominently it helps users to create excellent tables for summarizing data and building tables for regression output. The package is incredibly flexible, supports dozens of different model types, and Vincent is constantly adding new features.</p>
<p>Both packages are fantastic. If you’re interested in Bayesian modeling, or just looking for a new and easy way to build tables forwhatever modeling package you already use, you should check out one or both of these packages.</p>
