# Why me?

I have over a decade of training and experience in the social sciences, blending a advanced statistical techniques with a consistent focus on the substantive issues that matter to people. With these skills I can help you and your business identify solutions to complex and challenging problems. While others may have similar technical abilities, by background in political science means that whatever the statistical and computational methods I use, I will always maintain a focus on making sure you can easily identify the key takeaways and solutions that your business cares about. Beyond blending advanced statistical methods with a clear and concise presentation, I can also offer you these tools and insight for less than major consulting firms or an in-house data science team would cost. Technology should help us to break down barriers to comprehension, allowing us to better understand the issues we care aboutâ€”not create more confusion.

Increasingly these challenges involve wrangling large amounts of data as businesses try to better understand these problems and identify possible solutions.
