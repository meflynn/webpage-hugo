The goal of the troopdata package is to facilitate the distribution of military deployment and basing data for use in social science research and journalism. The troop deployment data were initially compiled by Tim Kane using information obtained from the U.S. Department of Defense's Defense Manpower Data Center (DMDC). The original data ended in 2005 and we have updated it to run through 2020. Similarly, the basing data were initially compiled by David Vine, and we have updated the original data using open source information from the U.S. military and press reports through 2018. We have also assembled this R package to allow users to more easily access the data and use it in their own research.

The package will be updated with additional features in the future, but for now please let me know if you find any errors.

Please refer to the bottom of this page for citation information.



## Installation

You can install the `troopdata` package from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=troopdata) or [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
install.package("troopdata)
devtools::install_github("meflynn/troopdata")
```



## Use

This package currently has two functions:

`get_troopdata()`: Returns a data frame containing country-year U.S. military deployment values. Depending on the arguments specified, either total troop deployments, or total deployments plus service branch-specific deployment values, are returned.

`get_basedata()`: Returns a data frame containing information on U.S. military bases around the globe from the Cold War forward. Depending on the arguments specified the function will return the entire data set or data for a particular country. Observations can be site-specific or can be aggregated to generate country counts.


## Example

### `get_troopdata`

The first function of this package is the `get_troopdata()` function. At its most basic this function returns a data frame of country-year troop deployment values for the selected time period, using the `startdate` and `enddate` parameters.

```{r example, warning=FALSE, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(troopdata)
## basic example code

# This example uses the basic function to gather total troop figure
example <- get_troopdata(startyear = 1990, endyear = 2020)

```


For users who want more refined data, the `host` argument and the `branch` arguments allow users to specify the set of host countries for which they would like data returned. This must be a single numerical value equal to a Correlates of War (COW) Project country code, a single character value equal to an ISO3C country code, or a vector of similar values. Note they must be consistent (i.e. they must all be numeric COW codes or ISO3C character codes).

For example, you can use a numeric vector of COW country codes:

```{r}

# Let's make the host selection more specific
hostlist <- c(200, 220)

example <- get_troopdata(host = hostlist, startyear = 1990, endyear = 2020)

head(example)

```

Or you can use a character vector of ISO3C codes.

```{r}

hostlist.char <- c("CAN", "GBR")

example.char <- get_troopdata(host = hostlist.char, startyear = 1970, endyear = 2020)

head(example.char)

```




```{r}

hostlist <- c(20, 200, 220)

example <- get_troopdata(host = hostlist, branch = TRUE, startyear = 2006, endyear = 2020)

head(example)

```

### `get_basedata`

The second function, `get_basedata()` returns a data frame containing information on the United States' overseas military bases going back to the beginning of the Cold War. At its most basic the function will return a data frame containing country-base observations, along with the facility's longitude and latitude (if available), and a series of binary variables indicating whether or not the facility is a full military base, a smaller lilypad, and if it is a currently funded site.

```{r}

baseexample <- get_basedata(host = NA, country_count = FALSE)

head(baseexample)

```

As with the `get_troopdata()` function you can specify a numeric vector of COW country codes or a character vector of ISO3C codes to specify specific host countries. 

For example, using COW country codes:
 
```{r}

hostlist <- c(20, 200, 255, 645)

baseexample <- get_basedata(host = hostlist, country_count = FALSE)

head(baseexample)

```

And another using ISO3C codes:

```{r}

hostlist.char <- c("CAN", "GBR", "PRI")

baseexample <- get_basedata(host = hostlist.char, country_count = FALSE)

```


Finally, users can also generate country-level counts of the number of U.S. military bases by changing the `country_count` argument to `TRUE`. 

```{r}

hostlist <- c(20, 200, 255, 645)

baseexample <- get_basedata(host = hostlist, country_count = TRUE)

head(baseexample)

```



## Applications

So what can you do with these super useful and cool data? Lots of things! The study of basing and military deployments has been picking up over the last few years and there are lots of cool studies you should check out. With these data you can do cool things like this!

```{r, echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE, dpi = 400}

library(ggplot2)

map <- ggplot2::map_data("world")
basepoints <- get_basedata(host = NA)


basemap <- ggplot() +
  geom_polygon(data = map, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group), fill = "gray80", color = "white", size = 0.1) +
  geom_point(data = basepoints, aes(x = lon, y = lat), color = "purple", alpha = 0.6) +
  coord_equal(ratio = 1.3) +
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.title = element_markdown(face = "bold", size = 15)) +
  labs(title = "Locations of U.S. military facilities, 1950-2018")


basemap

```



## A note on country codes

The original DMDC data contain information on U.S. troop deployments to a a wide range of locations, including several non-state territories. One downside of using the COW country codes as the primary host ID variable is that there are often no country codes for smaller states and territories. In the case of the Vine basing data, some smaller territories have COW codes for the imperial power that controls a territory. For example, Puerto Rico and Guam both receive a COW country code of 2 as they are territorial possessions of the United States. Users may want to distinguish such cases where deployments are present in a territory versus the metropole. Using the ISO country codes provides some additional flexibility when calling the data. Worst case, you can pull the full data frame and look around at the specific observations and figure out what best suits your needs.
